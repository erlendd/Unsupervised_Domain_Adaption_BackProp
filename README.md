# Unsupervised domain adaption by backpropagation

For a detailed description/explanation of the method please see the original paper [1], and/or my 
[blog post](https://erlendd.github.io/2017/10/11/unsupervised-domain-adaption-backprop.html) on the topic.

Based on the TensorFlow implementation of the method [here](https://github.com/pumpikano/tf-dann).
